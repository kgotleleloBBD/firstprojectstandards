# First Project Standards
The standard for the project

## Reference
https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules

## Stylistic Standards  
* Camelcase naming convention.  
* No spacing before and spacing after commas.  
* Consistent use of either single quotes in JSX attributes.  
* No spacing before keys and values, spacing after  keys and values in object literal properties.  
* Consistent spacing before and after keywords.  
* Use Unix linebreak style.  
* Require empty lines before comments.  
* Maximum amount of nests must not exceed 4.  
* Maximum line length of 240.  
* Maximum depth that callbacks can be nested must not exceed 4.  
* Constructor names to begin with a capital letter.  
* Empty line after var, let, or const.  
* No Array constructors.  
* No mixed whitespaces and tabs.  
* No multiple empty lines.  
* No trailing spaces.  
* No spaced functions.  
* Semicolons instead of ASI.  
* spacing after semicolons.  
* Enforce a whitespace after the comment literal.  
* Require spacing around infix and unary operators.  
* No spacing inside parentheses. 


## Best Practices  
* Curly braces on the next line.  
* Nocomplexity from 15 and beyond not allowed.  
* No new operators allowed.  
* No operators with functions allowed.  
* Don't allow void operators.  
* Don't allow with operators.  

## ECMAScript 6 (ES6)
* Enforces parentheses around arrow function parameters regardless of arity.  
* Normalize style of spacing before/after an arrow functionâ€™s arrow.  
* Flag invalid/missing super() calls.  
* Enforce consistent spacing around * operators in generator functions.  
* Flag modifying variables of class declarations.  
* Disallow reassigning const variables.  
* Disallow duplicate class members.  
* Disallow new operators with the Symbol object.  
* In the constructor of derived classes, if this/super are used before super() calls, it raises a reference error.  
* Disallow unnecessary constructors.  
* This rule is aimed at discouraging the use of var and encouraging the use of const or let instead.  
* If a variable is never reassigned, using the const declaration is better.  
* Require template literals instead of string concatenation.  
* This rule generates warnings for generator functions that do not have the yield keyword.  
* Require or disallow spacing around embedded expressions of template strings.  

## Possible errors  
* Require or disallow trailing commas  
* Disallow assignment operators in conditional expressions  
* Disallow unreachable code after return, throw, continue, and break statements
* Disallow empty block statements  
* Disallow variable or function declarations in nested blocks
